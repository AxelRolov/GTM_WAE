## Overview

Our project presents a computational pipeline for the rational de novo design of antimicrobial and anti-biofilm peptides based on an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework.
- üß¨ Combines Wasserstein Autoencoder (WAE) and Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM) for rational peptide design.
- üìä WAE learns the latent representation of the peptide space.
- üó∫Ô∏è GTM provides a 2D illustrative depiction of the latent space for generating novel peptides.
- üî¨ Experimentally verified efficacy against MRSA with a 100% hit rate in targeting biofilms.
- üöÄ Optimizable for additional peptide properties like cytotoxicity, aggregation, and proteolytic stability.

## Quick Start

To set up environment for attention WAE, run:

```bash
conda env create -f GTM_WAE.yml
conda activate GTM_WAE

pip install "GTM_WAE[all]"
```
