## Overview

Our project presents a computational pipeline for the rational de novo design of antimicrobial and anti-biofilm peptides based on an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework.
- üß¨ Combines Wasserstein Autoencoder (WAE) and Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM) for rational peptide design.
- üìä WAE learns the latent representation of the peptide space.
- üó∫Ô∏è GTM provides a 2D illustrative depiction of the latent space for generating novel peptides.
- üî¨ Experimentally verified efficacy against MRSA with a 100% hit rate in targeting biofilms.
- üöÄ Optimizable for additional peptide properties like cytotoxicity, aggregation, and proteolytic stability.

## Installation Guide for gtm_wae

Easily install `gtm_wae` using either `pip` or `Poetry`.

### Using pip

To install with `pip`, run the following command:

```sh
pip install gtm_wae
```

### Using Poetry

If you're managing your project with Poetry, add `gtm_wae` to your project using:

```sh
poetry add gtm_wae
```

Alternatively, you can manually add it to your `pyproject.toml` and then install it using:

```sh
poetry install
```
